            <h1>History of International Mother Language Day</h1>
            
            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">The history of International Mother Language Day dates back to the Bengali Language Movement of 1952 in present-day Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). After the partition of India in 1947, Pakistan was formed with two regions—West Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The government of Pakistan attempted to impose Urdu as the only state language, neglecting the fact that the majority of the population in East Pakistan spoke Bengali.</p>

            <h2>The Language Movement & Martyrs</h2>
            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">On 21st February 1952, students from Dhaka University, Jagannath College, and Dhaka Medical College organized a protest demanding the recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages. The protest turned violent when police opened fire, killing students including Rafiq, Salam, Barkat, Jabbar, and Shafiur.</p>

            <h2>Recognition of Bengali Language</h2>
            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">Due to continuous pressure and movements, in 1956, the Pakistan government declared Bengali as one of the official languages. However, the movement later became a crucial factor leading to the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, ultimately resulting in the independence of Bangladesh.</p>
            
            <h2>UNESCO’s Recognition</h2>
            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">To honor this historical struggle, UNESCO declared 21st February as International Mother Language Day on 17th November 1999. Since 2000, this day has been observed worldwide to promote linguistic diversity and cultural identity.</p>

            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">Today, International Mother Language Day is celebrated in over 190 countries* emphasizing the importance of preserving languages and linguistic rights.

            <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="0.5">Language is a vital part of cultural identity, and the recognition of 'International Mother Language Day' reminds the world about the importance of linguistic diversity. The sacrifice of the language martyrs in 1952 not only gave Bangladesh its linguistic freedom but also contributed to the preservation of many other languages worldwide.</p>

                        Rafiq Uddin Ahmed (1926-1952): Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, the eldest among five sons of Abdul Latif Miyan and Rafiza Khatun, was born on 30 October, 1926 at village Paril in Singair upazila of Manikganj district. From his childhood, Rafiq was distinguished as an encouraging, honest and patriotic social worker with passion for music and theatre. He staged and acted in various plays in the neighbouring villages.
                        Rafiq passed matriculation from Baira School in 1949.
                        While a student of Intermediate at Devendra College in Manikganj he discontinued his studies and moved to Dhaka. There he worked in his father's commercial printing business. In the meantime, he developed love relationship with his cousin Rahela Khanom Panu. Being informed, their parents organized their wedding. Accompanied by his nephew, Rafiq went to Dhaka for shopping for his forthcoming wedding.
                        However, on 21 February 1952, the students of Dhaka University, Dhaka Medical College and other schools and colleges organized a procession

                        in support of their demand for making Bangla one of the State Languages of Pakistan. Many mass people also joined the procession. Rafiq was one of them. On that day, although, he was scheduled to return home with his wedding shopping, he joined the protest rally, defying official ban on assemble of people imposed under Section 144, due to his love for Bangla language. The police opened fire on the demonstration in the premises of Dhaka Medical College Hostel. Rafiq was shot in the head and died at the spot. He is probably the first martyr of the language movement. His dead body was later dumped by the Pakistani commandos (who stole the dead bodies of language martyrs from Dhaka Medical college morgue) in the Azimpur grave yard. His grave could not be identified later. His love for his mother tongue surpassed his lifelong passion for his beloved Panu to whom he never returned as a groom.
